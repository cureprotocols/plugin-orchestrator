### 🔧 Overview

**Plugin Orchestrator** is a scoped plugin execution engine written in Rust, designed to reflect the real-world architectural principles of:

- 🧠 **OpenAI** → secure, AI-aligned plugin orchestration  
- 🛰️ **Anduril** → field-grade modular tooling with edge-safe fallbacks  
- 📡 **Palantir** → structured data flow, policy enforcement, and scoped intelligence

This is **signal-driven infrastructure**, not a toy project.  
It's designed for **real agents, real tools, and real missions.**

---

### 🚀 Features

- ✅ **Scoped plugin execution** (`plugin:xyz`) with deny-by-default access control  
- 🧩 **Modular plugin architecture** via trait-based dynamic execution (`PluginExecutor`)  
- 🔄 **REST interface** with `/execute` POST endpoint (Axum, JSON payloads)  
- 🔐 **Panic-safe sandboxing** using `.catch_unwind()` with `futures`  
- 🐳 **Dockerized static binary** (built with Alpine + MUSL)  
- 📦 **MIT licensed** – production ready, remixable, royalty-free

### 📦 Example Plugins

| Plugin | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| `echo` | Repeats back your message |
| `time` | Returns current UTC timestamp |

More plugins can be added easily by implementing the `PluginExecutor` trait.
